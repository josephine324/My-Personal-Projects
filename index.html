      <h2 id="time">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li><br>
        <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to<br> a Depression era program
          known as the "National Youth Administration"</li><br>
        <li>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br>Conservation Corps, helping starving
          Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said.<br> "All of this left scars on me."</li><br>
        <li>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li><br>
        <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts.<br> Inspired by Elvin Charles
          Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, <br>who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li><br>
        <li>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, <br>but is rejected. Instead, the military
          asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, <br>DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.<br>
        </li><br>
        <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li><br>
        <li>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, <br>and flies to Mexico to
          head a new plant pathology program. <br>Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease
          resistent wheat - <br>including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li><br>
        <li>1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li><br>
        <li>1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,<br> creating a strain
          that responds well to fertilizer. <br>It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li><br>
        <li>1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent <br>in time to help
          mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li><br>
        <li>1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li><br>
        <li>1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li><br>
        <li>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li><br>
        <li>2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."<br> Argues that genetically modified crops
          are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land.<br> Says that GM crops are not inherently
          dangerous because <br>"we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called
          it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li><br>
        <li>2009 - dies at the age of 95.</li><br>
      </ul>
